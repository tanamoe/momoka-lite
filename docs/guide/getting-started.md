# Getting Started
Tana.moe back-end was built mainly using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/), which users could request and send data using RESTful APIs.

## API endpoints
Mostly all of Tana.moe API endpoints are using the same base URL, that is:
```
https://tana.moe/api/
```
Otherwise, our image processing server URL is at:
```
https://image.tana.moe/
```
